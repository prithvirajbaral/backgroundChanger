# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# background changer

This is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the screen by selecting different color options. The selected color is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so the background color persists even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- Change the background color to red, green, blue, or yellow.
- The selected color is saved to `localStorage` to maintain state between sessions.
- Responsive design with a fixed color selection bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
